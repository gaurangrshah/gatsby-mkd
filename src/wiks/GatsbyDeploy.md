# Deploying Gatsby

1. Setup a github repo (ensure we are not commiting the .env-file.)
2. Setup Netlify account
3. Once setup, then connect github account,
4. Select repository to deploy
5. Include any .env variables we have.



## Redeploy after changes

>  Changes from Netlify:
>
> Once changes are made we must trigger another deploy from netlify:
>
> - Select: `clear cache and deploy`

> Changes from Markdown or to codebase:
>
> Once changes are made, we must first commit and push all changes to the repo then:
>
> - this will automatically trigger a new deploy and build.
